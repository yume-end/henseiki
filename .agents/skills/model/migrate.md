# Atlas Declarative Migration Reference

This starter uses Atlas declarative workflow (`atlas schema apply`), not versioned migration files. There are no migration files to generate or apply.

## Required inputs

- Which environment the user means: local or production
- The schema change they made, if they want help interpreting the plan
- The Atlas error output, if they are debugging

## Commands

- **Local:** `pnpm atlas` — runs `atlas schema apply --env dev` against `data/dev.db`
- **Production:** `pnpm atlas:prod` — runs `dotenv -- atlas schema apply --env prod` (requires `DB_URL` and `DB_AUTH_TOKEN`)

Atlas reads the Drizzle schema, compares it to the database, shows a plan, and asks for confirmation.

## Common scenarios

**New table added:** Atlas will show `CREATE TABLE ...` and create the table if applied.

**Column added to existing table:** Atlas will show `ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN ...`. SQLite limitations still apply for more invasive schema changes.

**Column removed:** Atlas may drop or recreate structures depending on the change. This can delete data.

**Fresh start:** Delete `data/dev.db` and run `pnpm atlas` again to recreate from scratch.

## Rules

- NEVER run `atlas`, `drizzle-kit`, or migration commands yourself. The user runs these manually.
- NEVER use `atlas migrate apply` or `atlas migrate diff`. This starter has no migration files. Always use `atlas schema apply`.
- Prefer `pnpm atlas` and `pnpm atlas:prod` when instructing the user, since those are the starter's package scripts.
- If the user reports an Atlas error, help debug by reading the schema and the error message.
